# Financial Forecasting for McDonald's: A **Comparative Analysis** of ARIMA and LSTM Models

## Introduction
This project aims to forecast the revenue of **McDonald's** using two different time-series forecasting techniques: **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. The goal is to compare the performance of these models in predicting McDonald's revenue and provide insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Imported** necessary libraries and **loaded** the financial dataset of McDonald's from a CSV file.
- Checked for **missing values** and inspected **data types** for consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted **exploratory analysis** to gain insights into underlying trends and patterns.
- Analyzed **summary statistics**, visualized revenue trends over the years, and decomposed time series to identify **trends** and **seasonality**.
- Examined the **distribution** of revenue using histograms, analyzed **annual growth rates**, and visualized financial metrics comparisons.
- Explored **correlations** between different financial metrics using **correlation matrices** and **pairplots**.

## ARIMA Forecasting
- Applied the **ARIMA model** to forecast McDonald's revenue.
- Decomposed the time series, **fitted** the ARIMA model with appropriate parameters, and generated forecasts for future time periods.
- Compared forecasted values with **actual revenue data** using visualizations.

## LSTM Forecasting
- **Normalized** the revenue data and created input sequences for the **LSTM model**.
- Constructed an **LSTM neural network** with two LSTM layers and a dense output layer.
- Trained the model using historical revenue data and evaluated its performance on a test set.
- Made **predictions** for future time periods and compared them with ARIMA forecasts and actual revenue data.

## Results and Conclusion
- Compared **ARIMA and LSTM models** in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in forecasting McDonald's revenue.
- Provided insights into the suitability of each model for financial forecasting tasks.
- Offered recommendations for further improvements and future research directions.

## Conclusion
Financial forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for businesses, and this project demonstrates the application of two popular forecasting methods, ARIMA and LSTM, in predicting McDonald's revenue. By comparing and contrasting the performance of these models, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize business strategies and financial planning.
